Hello. This is a blog website template built with a React frontend and PHP backend with a SQL database.<br>
The original inspiration is from this [YouTube tuorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQYpSfXUgn4) byâ€‚Zarx Biz<br/><br/>
See my implementation: https://emilydaitch.click/<br/>

I have chosen to use Hostinger to host the site although there are many hosts that could work. For local development I use [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) Apache and MySQL. It is possible to use the live-update "yarn start" for faster iteration, and to have that frontend connect to the database managed in XAMPP, which I will explain in more detail in the DEVELOPMENT.md file.<br/><br/>
I recommend using a staging subdomain to test your changes before letting them "go live", like I have done here: https://staging.emilydaitch.click/<br/>
I will explain this in the HOSTING.md document.<br/>
<br/>
This template consists of:<br/>
 - A home page with a paginated list of blog posts
 - A page for viewing the full contents of selected single blog posts
 - A resume page
 - A "Contact Me" page
 - A calendar page for displaying availability and to offer scheduling
 - Components are from the Chakra UI library
 - Light/Dark Mode toggling and centralized theme definitions with extendTheme from Chakra UI
 - For fun, an optional page that connects to the Strava exercise app API and displays workout data with CanvasJS charts
<br/>
Soon, I will be decoupling this from create-react-app because that tool has been deprecated and no longer receives support.
