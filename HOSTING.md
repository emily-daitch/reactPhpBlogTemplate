# Hosting with Hostinger
I will be explaining how to use Hostinger to host your own site using this template.</br>
You will need to change the package.json homepage to your domain "https://your-domain.com"<br>
I will explain how to manage your post data, and how to set up a staging subdomain so that you can test deployments without breaking your main site.
<br><br>Work in progress.
